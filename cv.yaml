research_interests: "My research passion lies in dissecting and addressing the molecular basis of human disease. To address these complex questions, I have developed a strong technical background in next-generation sequencing, CRISPR-based genome editing, data science, and machine learning. In my PhD, I have applied these skills to characterize LINE-1 retrotransposon activity in brain aging and disease."
